# graphstream-fx

GraphStream is a graph library totally written in Java. In this project, I will show how to use this library with a JavaFX UI. For that, we need the newest lib jars from the project which I linked below. Remember that these libraries are still in alpha state.

* [GraphStream](http://graphstream-project.org/)
* [gs-core](https://github.com/graphstream/gs-core/releases)
* [gs-ui-javafx](https://github.com/graphstream/gs-ui-javafx/releases)
